# NFT-Preview-card
## Description
This is an nft preview card, A challenge that was hosted by
frontendMentor.io. it is a simple nft preview card that can be used to display 

## Challenges Faced
* One of the challenge that i faced was not being able to get a border around the pfp.
* I also faced positioning the image in the component in the center of the page but after countless tutorials and alteracions i was able to find the simplest way of acheiving that.

It was a very great learning experience so far i really enjoyed writting bugs and fixing them.

## ShoutOuts
w3schools, Mdn Docs, and some websites i cant remember
